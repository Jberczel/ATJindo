           <p> There are many reasons I'm attempting to thru-hike the AT.  I plan to give a thorough answer after my trip.  For now, here's a short, influential story I heard:</p>
            <blockquote>Go after your life.  Don't wait.  The best advice I ever got was from a woman on her 100th birthday party.  We said 'Speech, speech! Give us some words of wisdom.'  She said I've got three words for you: 'Do it now!' <small> <cite>Dr. Doug McGuff</cite></small></blockquote>

          2. How many people hike the Appalachian Trail?

           2-3 Million people visit the trail, but only 1,800-2000 attempt a thru-hike.  A thru-hike is hiking the entire 2,180 miles in one trip.  Most thru-hikers begin in Georgia, but I will travel south-bound in the opposite direction.  Approximately 1 in 4 thru-hikers complete the entire trail.

            <p>I've heard the faster hikers can walk the entire Appalachian Trail in little over 100 days. That would be 20+ miles per day without any rest days!  Since I'm bringing Nara, I'm not going to push for such an aggressive pace.  Most successful thru-hikers generally complete their hike in 4-6 months.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure what I'll be eating later, but my starting menu will look something like this:</p>
            <p><b>Breakfast:</b> oatmeal, dried berries, cereal bars, coffee</p>
            <p><b>Lunch:</b> beef jerky, dried fruit, dried squid, candy bars, cheese, chocolate</p>
            <p><b>Dinner:</b> chicken or tuna, mashed potatoes, pasta side or quinoa all mixed together</p>

            <p>Most days I will be sleeping in a 2-person tent with Nara.  The Appalachian trail has a network of 3-sided shelters spread out about every 10 miles, which are first come first serve.  Shelters are built and maintained by trail clubs in every State, so a big thank you to all the volunteers.  If vacant or not crowded, I will stay at shelters. I'm going to try and limit my time in towns, but every few weeks, I will likely be staying in motels/hostels from time to time to wash up, recuperate, and to take a break from the woods.</p>

            I rented a one-way car from Virginia to Maine.  The car company has a pet-freindly policy.  Buses don't allow dogs, and if I flew, Nara would have to ride in cargo, so the car rental seemed like the best option at the time.
