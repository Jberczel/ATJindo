		<p>"The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest continuously marked footpath in the world, measuring roughly 2,180 miles in length. The Trail goes through fourteen states along the crests and valleys of the Appalachian mountain range from the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, Georgia, to the Trail’s northern terminus at Katahdin, Maine.</p>
		
		<p>Known as the “A.T.,” it has been estimated that 2-3 million people visit the Trail every year and about 1,800–2,000 people attempt to “thru-hike” the Trail. People from across the globe are drawn to the A.T. for a variety of reasons: to reconnect with nature, to escape the stress of city life, to meet new people or deepen old friendships, or to experience a simpler life."</p>

<h2 class="center">About Us</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span10 offset1 well paddit">
		<p>Hi, my name is Jamie, and I will be attempting a south-bound 2013 Appalachian Trail thru-hike with my dog Nara.  My prior hiking experience includes trekking across Spain on the Camino de Santiago (550 miles from St Jean Pied de Port, France to Santiago de Compostela, Spain), multi-day hikes through Shenandoah National Park, Virginia and Big Sur, California, and several other weekend hikes.</p>

		<p>Nara is my 2-year old Jindo. She goes hiking with me on the weekends and always seems to have more energy than me.  She will join me on my thru-hike.</p>

		<p>One of the objectives of this website is to provide a firsthand account and information on long-distance hiking with a dog for anyone that is interested and planning a similiar pursuit.
		
		<p>For anyone that would like to follow our journey, you can visit our <a href="/blog/{{state}}">trail blog</a> as we travel down the Appalachian Trail:</p>
